## Java game

Two branches:

- feat/RL: add reinforcement learning using Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks. The computer should learn 
that the optimal strategy is to always attack
- feat/skills: add skills. For now, this is:
  - BLOCK: halves damage received this turn
  - CHARGE: doubles damage output next turn. If attacked, this will be cancelled.
